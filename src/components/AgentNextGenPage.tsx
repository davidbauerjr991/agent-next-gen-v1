   card folds it into that same card *only* when it's the same channel type
   on the same address (restarting its timer) — a different address on the
   same type (e.g. a second SMS thread on a different number) opens as its
   own additional row instead of replacing the first, since it's a genuinely
   separate conversation. "Unassign & Dismiss" (any channel's kebab menu)
   removes just that channel via InteractionNavItem's `onDismissChannel`
   when others are still open, or the whole card via `onDismiss` when it was
   the last one — see `handleDismissChannel`/`handleDismissInteraction`. */

   A recent-customer-contacts summary — name, resolution status, an optional
   "Redial" action for voice contacts, a one-line case summary, case ID, and
   (right-aligned) the channel + how long ago it happened, plus the handle
   time. The base 5 rows (`CONTACT_HISTORY`) are from a screenshot of
   exactly this content, so those values are that screenshot's own data,
   not derived from any other part of the app. Composed entirely from
   existing lyra-ui atoms — `DashboardCard` for the card shell
   (`headerActions` holding the same `DateFilterChip` the Performance/
   Productivity cards' own headers use, not a one-off "View All" button, so
   this card's date control matches theirs exactly), `Tag` for the status
   pill (`variant="success"` for Resolved, `"warning"` for Transferred —
   the same bordered-tint look CONTRIBUTING.md's Tag entry documents), and
   a plain `Button variant="outline"` for "Redial" (reusing the same
   `PhoneOutgoing` icon `InteractionRowActions`' kebab menu already uses for
   its own "Redial" action, rather than inventing a second icon for the
   same meaning) — no hand-rolled badge/pill markup.

   Row set is driven by the selected date range (`CONTACT_HISTORY_BY_RANGE`):
   "Today" (the default on login — nothing has happened yet this session)
   and "Custom" (no range chosen yet) both render empty, showing a
   "Nothing to Display" placeholder instead of an empty list; "Yesterday"
   shows the base 5 rows; "Last 7 days" widens that with 5 more rows pulled
   from the shared customer "database" (`CREATE_NEW_CUSTOMERS`, the same
   fixture `OUTBOUND_CUSTOMERS` above already sources from) rather than
   inventing unrelated names, so a wider range reads as more of the same
   real customer base. */

  /* ── Preventing duplicate channels from the CreateNew picker ──
     A contact already reachable via a currently-open channel (e.g. Jamie
     Torres has an SMS interaction open on a specific number) still shows
     that channel in "Select Channel" and every address in the detail
     screen's second field ("Select Phone"/"Select Email Address"/"Select
     WhatsApp Handle") — except whichever exact address(es) are already in
     use, which are disabled so starting another interaction on one of them
     wouldn't just duplicate the one already running (a different outbound
     line for the same channel — or a second, still-unused one, even when
     one SMS number is already open — stays selectable).
     `CreateNewOutboundContact.openChannelAddresses` is exactly the
     mechanism `CreateNew` exposes for this (see its own doc comment), so
     rather than adding new disabling logic to that shared component, this
     derives a per-render copy of OUTBOUND_CONFIG that tags each contact
     with every address in use for whichever channels they already have
     open in `interactions` (read off each `TrackedChannel.value`, set at
     start-call time — a contact can have more than one channel of the same
     type open at once, e.g. two SMS threads on different numbers, so this
     is a list per channel type, not a single address), across every group
     (Agents/Teams/Skills/Customers — Favorites is derived from these same
     records, so it inherits the tagging automatically). Recomputed
     whenever `interactions` changes so an address re-enables the moment its
     interaction is dismissed. */

          Overlay component (variant="light": frosted blur backdrop,
          portal-rendered via Radix Dialog) rather than a hand-rolled backdrop
          div, so it actually dims/blurs the dashboard behind it like a real
          overlay instead of just painting over it. Not dismissible via
          backdrop click or Escape — only the two buttons close it.

          Overlay's "light" variant is a fixed `bg-white/70` by design (see
          Overlay.stories.tsx — "light" vs. "dark" are two deliberately
          static, theme-independent overlay looks, not meant to react to
          dark mode). This page's backdrop needs to actually match the
          current theme, so we override just the background color via
          `className` (twMerge drops the variant's `bg-white/70` for this
          `bg-[color-mix(...)]`, keeping `backdrop-blur-sm`). We use
          color-mix() instead of a plain `bg-lyra-bg-surface-shell/70`
          opacity modifier because Tailwind can't generate opacity-modified
          utilities for our `var(--lyra-color-*)` tokens (same root cause as
          the Tag border-color bug — see lyra-ui's PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).

          The card itself is the shared `AgentWelcomeMessage` lyra-ui
          component (icon/title/lastLogin block + info-box slot + Divider +
          two-button footer, all via `Container variant="modal"` — same
          shell `LoginCard` uses, so every modal in the app shares one
          background) rather than hand-rolled markup local to this app. ── */}
